### Social Impact DAO
Focuses on social impact initiatives. Members can propose and support projects that address environmental, social, or governance challenges. Funding can be allocated to support sustainable development, charitable causes, or community-driven initiatives.

### How does it work
To become a stakeholder, contribute a minimum of 5 MATIC. Only stakeholders have the ability to create new proposals. If you wish to contribute to the project without becoming a stakeholder, you can contribute any amount and become a project contributor. As a contributor, you have the power to upvote or downvote proposals during the 1-week voting period. Please note that proposals cannot be cancelled before this period ends. After the voting period, if a proposal receives more upvotes than downvotes, the funds can be transferred to the initiative's address. However, if the proposal fails to achieve more upvotes than downvotes, the transfer of funds will not be possible, and only cancellation is possible.
